# fifimon

fifimon stands for FIFI-LS monitor.

This software reads files generated by the FIFI-LS instrument when observing from SOFIA.
As they appear in the archive directory, they are processed and displayed to show the positions of the observation (different pointings) and average spectra taken. This allows one to follow the perfomance of the instrument with variable conditions (zenithal angle, altitude, water vapor) to check in real time if part of the observations need to be redone in order to have homogeneous observations.

The same code can be used also once the observation is completed to check the quality of the data and eventually discover problems occurred during the observation.
